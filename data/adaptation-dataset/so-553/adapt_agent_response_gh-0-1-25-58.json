  "explanation": "code_hardening: Added validation for null or empty sourceUrl and destinationFilePath, used try-with-resources to guarantee stream closure, and configured connection and read timeouts on URLConnection.\nresolve_compilation_errors: Removed the undefined variable from the SO snippet by using the existing class-level buffer size constant (size), updated the method signature to accept destinationFilePath, and aligned all local variables with the new signature.\nexception_handling: Replaced the broad Exception catch with specific MalformedURLException and IOException catches, and eliminated the finally block by relying on try-with-resources for safe cleanup.\nlogic_customization: Changed output stream creation to write directly to the provided destinationFilePath, removed manual path concatenation and OS-specific separators, and preserved the original download loop logic.\nrefactoring: Renamed parameters for clarity (sourceUrl, destinationFilePath), removed unused byte-count logic, and simplified local variable usage to the minimum required.\nmisc: Simplified logging to a single success message that reports the final destination path; no additional custom APIs beyond standard JDK classes were introduced."
