  "explanation": "code_hardening: Validated the instance field usage by defensively handling negative or very small durations; durations less than or equal to one second immediately return a safe default. Early returns avoid unnecessary object creation.\nresolve_compilation_errors: Removed static context and parameters, computed duration from the instance field time, and relied on existing in-scope constants (ONE_SECOND, ONE_MINUTE, ONE_HOUR, ONE_DAY). No imports were required.\nexception_handling: none.\nlogic_customization: Computed duration as System.currentTimeMillis() minus the instance field time, returned only the largest non-zero unit using early returns, enforced the <= ONE_SECOND → \"0 second\" rule, and applied singular/plural semantics where singular returns only the unit name.\nrefactoring: Introduced a new instance method named getTimes, simplified the logic to a linear days→hours→minutes→seconds check, and removed concatenation, commas, and additional wording.\nmisc: Updated the method comment to reflect the new behavior and semantics. No new custom API calls were introduced."
