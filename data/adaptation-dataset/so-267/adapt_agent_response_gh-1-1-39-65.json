  "explanation": "code_hardening: Initialized the return variable to null, safely handled potentially null enumerations, and ensured a single return path that explicitly returns null when no suitable IP is found.\nresolve_compilation_errors: Changed the signature to public static String getIpAddress() to match callers; relied on existing imports in the file without adding new ones.\nexception_handling: Preserved the try/catch structure and continued to wrap SocketException in a RuntimeException without introducing checked exceptions.\nlogic_customization: Removed all System.out.println calls and display name usage, maintained filtering of loopback and inactive interfaces, captured IP addresses during iteration, and returned the last IP found (or null).\nrefactoring: Converted the instance-style method into a static utility method, renamed it to getIpAddress, removed unnecessary instance context, and added a concise Javadoc with attribution and description.\nmisc: none"}
