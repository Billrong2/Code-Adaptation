  "explanation": "code_hardening: Ensured a non-null return by always falling back to \"0.0.0.0\"; added null checks around enumerations, interfaces, names, and addresses; kept an explicit IPv4 length check and used final locals where appropriate.\nresolve_compilation_errors: Renamed the method to getWifiIpAddress, made it package-private and static, and added the @Thunk annotation; used fully qualified names inside the function to avoid import issues.\nexception_handling: Broadened the catch from SocketException to Exception and replaced Android Log usage with com.painless.pc.singleton.Debug.log(e).\nlogic_customization: Preserved the core logic of iterating NetworkInterface instances, filtering by names containing \"wlan\", and returning the first non-loopback IPv4 address synchronously with no side effects.\nrefactoring: Removed all debug IP logging, simplified control flow with while loops, and aligned naming and structure with the surrounding codebase.\nmisc: Added a comment crediting the StackOverflow source as required; no other logging or side effects were introduced. New custom API calls used: com.painless.pc.singleton.Debug.log(Throwable)."
