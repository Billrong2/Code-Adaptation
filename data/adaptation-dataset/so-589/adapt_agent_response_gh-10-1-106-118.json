  "explanation": "code_hardening: added a null check for the bytes parameter to avoid NullPointerException and marked the parameter as final to clarify immutability.\nresolve_compilation_errors: removed the static modifier and made the method private so it can be used as an instance method within the same class; no external API calls were introduced.\nexception_handling: none.\nlogic_customization: none; the hex conversion logic and output format are unchanged.\nrefactoring: changed visibility from public to private, removed static, and replaced StringBuffer with StringBuilder as thread-safety is not required in this context.\nmisc: kept formatting and naming consistent with the surrounding class style; no new custom API calls were added."
