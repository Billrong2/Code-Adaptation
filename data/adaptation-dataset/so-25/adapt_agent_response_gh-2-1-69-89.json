  "explanation": "code_hardening: No additional state validation was added because the instance fields num, n, and r are initialized and validated in the constructor and the original algorithm assumes valid state.\nresolve_compilation_errors: Removed all parameters from the method signature and replaced references to num, n, and r with the corresponding instance fields already present in the class.\nexception_handling: none.\nlogic_customization: Updated the method to operate purely on instance fields while preserving the exact algorithm and return semantics from the Stack Overflow snippet.\nrefactoring: Changed the method from public static final to a private instance method and renamed it from getNext to nextNum to match the existing call graph.\nmisc: Applied minor formatting consistent with the surrounding class style; no new custom API calls were introduced."
