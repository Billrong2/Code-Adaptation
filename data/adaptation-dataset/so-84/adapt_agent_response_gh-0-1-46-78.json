  "explanation": "code_hardening: none\nresolve_compilation_errors: Renamed the method to execSuCommand while preserving the static modifier, return type, and varargs signature; ensured calls to readFully(InputStream) and Closer.closeSilently(Object...) match existing project methods.\nexception_handling: Preserved the original try/catch structure for IOException and InterruptedException without adding or removing handling logic.\nlogic_customization: Added a side effect to print the fully captured command output to standard output using System.out.println(res) immediately after reading it, without changing control flow or the returned value.\nrefactoring: Renamed the method from sudoForResult to execSuCommand as required, with no other structural or behavioral refactoring.\nmisc: none"
