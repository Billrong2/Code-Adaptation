  "explanation": "code_hardening: Marked parameters and locals as final for immutability; no explicit range validation is performed to avoid behavioral changes.\nresolve_compilation_errors: Renamed the method to computeDistanceInMiles and provided a complete static method compatible with the existing Geometry class; no additional compilation issues.\nexception_handling: None; the method remains a pure mathematical computation with no checked exceptions.\nlogic_customization: Updated the API to expect all latitude/longitude inputs in radians, removed all degree-to-radian conversions, computed dLat and dLon as direct differences, used Math.cos(lat1/lat2) directly, retained the Haversine formula, and fixed earthRadius at 3958.75 miles.\nrefactoring: Renamed the method to reflect semantics, clarified variable names (lon instead of lng), and added clear Javadoc documenting units and behavior.\nmisc: Added concise Javadoc with a reference link and minor formatting/comment updates; no other behavioral changes."
