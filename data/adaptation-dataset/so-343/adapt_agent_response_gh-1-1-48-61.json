  "explanation": "code_hardening: Added null and boundary checks for input string and interval to avoid runtime errors, and marked parameters as final for immutability.\nresolve_compilation_errors: Changed the method to private static so it can be called from convertBluetoothToNdefFormat without relying on instance state; no other compilation dependencies were introduced.\nexception_handling: none.\nlogic_customization: Preserved the original splitting logic and output behavior while moving the j increment into the for-loop header with no behavioral changes.\nrefactoring: Adjusted method signature visibility and static modifier, and slightly restructured loop variables for clarity without altering logic.\nmisc: Added a source reference comment placeholder for the originating Stack Overflow post; no new custom API calls were introduced."
