  "explanation": "code_hardening: Added guards for null input, empty strings, and non-positive interval values to safely return an empty array and avoid invalid calculations or out-of-bounds access.\nresolve_compilation_errors: Converted the method to a private static utility so it matches the existing static call from formatText; no new APIs were introduced.\nexception_handling: none\nlogic_customization: Preserved the original chunking logic but added a conditional check before assigning the final segment to ensure the result array has at least one element, preventing errors when the input is empty.\nrefactoring: Updated the method signature to private static to reflect its utility role within the class and removed any instance-based assumptions.\nmisc: Added a brief inline comment clarifying why the final assignment is guarded; no additional logging or documentation changes were required."
