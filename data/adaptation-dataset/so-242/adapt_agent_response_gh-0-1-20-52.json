  "explanation": "code_hardening: No additional precondition checks were enforced to avoid altering existing behavior; local variables and logic remain identical to the original snippet.\nresolve_compilation_errors: The method is adapted to the existing class context where the `data` field and `java.util.Arrays` import already exist; method name and signature match the caller.\nexception_handling: No new exceptions were introduced, preserving the original behavior and expectations of existing callers.\nlogic_customization: None; the algorithm, assumptions (sorted input), and tie-breaking behavior are unchanged.\nrefactoring: Only trivial formatting and brace style adjustments were applied; variable names and structure mirror the original implementation.\nmisc: None; no new APIs or helpers were introduced."
