  "explanation": "code_hardening: Ensured getAcceptedIssuers returns a non-null empty X509Certificate array, marked TrustManager[] and HostnameVerifier locals as final, and added JavaDoc warning about test-only usage and security implications.\nresolve_compilation_errors: Renamed the method to disableCertificateValidation, made it public and non-static to match its usage from setUp, and aligned the signature with the existing imports and calling context.\nexception_handling: Removed internal try/catch blocks and declared throws GeneralSecurityException on the method signature so callers can handle or propagate initialization failures.\nlogic_customization: Switched SSLContext creation from \"SSL\" to \"TLS\" and preserved the behavior of installing an all-trusting TrustManager and HostnameVerifier on HttpsURLConnection.\nrefactoring: Renamed the method for clarity, added @Override annotations to implemented interface methods, and slightly restructured comments for readability without changing behavior.\nmisc: Added concise JavaDoc and minor formatting updates consistent with the surrounding test code; no new custom API calls were introduced."
