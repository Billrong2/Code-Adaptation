  "explanation": "code_hardening: none\nresolve_compilation_errors: The method is converted to an instance method (non-static), which removes static access; no additional compilation fixes are applied within this function itself.\nexception_handling: The declared UnsupportedEncodingException is preserved exactly as in the original snippet; no try/catch behavior was changed.\nlogic_customization: none; the method body, parameters, and logic are kept identical to the Stack Overflow snippet.\nrefactoring: Changed the method signature from public static to private instance scope to restrict access to within the class, as required by the intent.\nmisc: Added a comment above the method attributing the original source to Stack Overflow (placeholder for link/ID)."}
