  "explanation": "code_hardening: Selected the explicit \"TLS\" protocol instead of deprecated \"SSL\", added a null check before returning the socket factory, and marked trust managers and local variables as final to improve immutability and safety.\nresolve_compilation_errors: Used fully qualified names for javax.net.ssl.SSLSocketFactory and related SSL classes to avoid conflicts with org.apache.http.conn.ssl.SSLSocketFactory present in the codebase, and defined the method as static for utility-style access.\nexception_handling: Replaced silent exception swallowing with explicit catching of NoSuchAlgorithmException and KeyManagementException, returning null on failure as specified.\nlogic_customization: Removed all global side effects by not calling HttpsURLConnection.setDefaultSSLSocketFactory and changed the behavior to return a configured trust-all SSLSocketFactory for caller-controlled usage.\nrefactoring: Extracted the logic into a reusable static utility method named getTrustAllSSLSocketFactory, removed URL access and unrelated example code, and used a clear, utility-oriented method name.\nmisc: Updated inline comments to clarify the trust-all behavior and formatted the method to align with standard style; no new custom API calls beyond core JDK SSL APIs were introduced."
