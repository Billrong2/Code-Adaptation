  "explanation": "code_hardening: Added an early null check on the input View and ensured recursive calls go through the same guarded static method.\nresolve_compilation_errors: Updated the method to be public static, removed any instance reliance, and used fully qualified Android class names to avoid import issues.\nexception_handling: none.\nlogic_customization: Preserved the original cleanup logic and updated recursive calls to use the new static method name.\nrefactoring: Renamed the method to freeViewResources to better describe its purpose and converted it into a utility-style static helper.\nmisc: Added a concise documentation comment and applied minor formatting consistent with a utility method style. No new custom API calls were introduced."
