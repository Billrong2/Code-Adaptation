  "explanation": "code_hardening: Added null checks for the top-level array and each subarray to avoid NullPointerException and to safely handle jagged or partially null 3D arrays. Marked the parameter as final to prevent reassignment.\nresolve_compilation_errors: Updated the method signature and all internal allocations to use Block[][][] instead of int[][][]. No additional imports were required because Block is already available in the class context.\nexception_handling: None added, as the logic is purely array-based and no checked exceptions are expected.\nlogic_customization: Preserved the original shape-preserving copy logic using System.arraycopy, with the intentional semantic shift to copying Block object references, resulting in a shallow copy consistent with setCenter’s usage.\nrefactoring: Changed method visibility from public to private, renamed the local variable from copy to result for clarity, and added a concise documentation comment describing purpose and shallow-copy semantics.\nmisc: Added brief Javadoc comments noting that Block objects themselves are not cloned; no new custom API calls were introduced."
