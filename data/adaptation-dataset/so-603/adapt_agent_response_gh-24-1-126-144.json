  "explanation": "code_hardening: none; the function preserves existing behavior without adding null checks or validation.\nresolve_compilation_errors: renamed the method to compareVersionStrings to match updated callers such as getRawKey; no new imports or dependencies were introduced.\nexception_handling: none; NumberFormatException behavior remains unchanged and uncaught as in the original logic.\nlogic_customization: replaced Integer.signum(...) with explicit ternary expressions returning -1, 0, or 1 while preserving component-wise numeric comparison and length-based ordering.\nrefactoring: renamed the method from versionCompare to compareVersionStrings and applied minor formatting and whitespace adjustments without changing behavior.\nmisc: removed the detailed Javadoc and added a brief attribution comment referencing the original Stack Overflow source; no new custom API calls were introduced."
