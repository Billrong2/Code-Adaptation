  "explanation": "code_hardening: Added null checks for textField and autoSuggestionsPopUpWindow, ensured the label is focusable, validated that the suggestion text is non-null and non-empty before applying it.\nresolve_compilation_errors: Implemented the missing initComponent method, used existing Swing APIs available to JLabel/JComponent, and consistently referenced autoSuggestionsPopUpWindow (updated name). No additional imports were required.\nexception_handling: none.\nlogic_customization: Removed all popup sizing, positioning, visibility management, and repaint logic. Introduced interaction-driven behavior: mouse click and Enter key release both apply the suggestion via replaceWithSuggestedText and then hide the popup. Bound the Enter key at the component level using InputMap/ActionMap.\nrefactoring: Repurposed showPopUpWindow responsibilities into initComponent focused on initialization and interaction setup. Centralized the repeated apply-and-hide logic into a single Runnable within the method.\nmisc: Set the foreground color to suggestionsTextColor, enabled focusability to support keyboard interaction, and performed minor cleanup by avoiding unused popup-management code. New custom API calls used: javax.swing.JComponent#getInputMap(int), javax.swing.JComponent#getActionMap(), javax.swing.KeyStroke#getKeyStroke(int,int,boolean), javax.swing.AbstractAction."
