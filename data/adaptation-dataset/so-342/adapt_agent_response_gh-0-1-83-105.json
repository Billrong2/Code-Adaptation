  "explanation": "code_hardening: Added null checks for the varargs array and individual objects, ensured all cleanup is centralized in this utility, and made the method resilient by swallowing all throwables during close attempts.\nresolve_compilation_errors: Implemented the previously missing Closer.closeSilently utility with a varargs signature compatible with existing callers; used fully qualified names for Closeable, Socket, DatagramSocket, and Log where appropriate.\nexception_handling: Wrapped each close attempt in a try/catch that catches Throwable, logging errors without allowing any exception to propagate and potentially crash the app.\nlogic_customization: Added explicit handling for Closeable, Socket, and DatagramSocket (to support pre-API 19), logged each close attempt, logged unsupported types with a \"cannot close\" message, and deliberately threw and caught a RuntimeException to guarantee an error log.\nrefactoring: Extracted and consolidated all resource-closing logic into this reusable varargs method, simplifying callers’ finally blocks and improving readability.\nmisc: Added debug and error log statements consistent with Android logging style using the existing AIPROUTE_SHELL tag; no new custom APIs beyond standard Android/Java classes were introduced."
