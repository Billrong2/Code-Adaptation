  "explanation": "code_hardening: Added a null check in the finally block to ensure the Socket is always closed safely, marked the method parameter as final, and explicitly set the socket option setReuseAddress(true) immediately after socket creation to harden networking behavior.\nresolve_compilation_errors: Replaced all System.out.println calls with getLogger().debug(...) to align with the existing SLF4J logging infrastructure provided by TestUtils.getLogger(); used fully qualified names (java.net.InetSocketAddress, java.io.IOException) where imports were not present.\nexception_handling: Preserved the IOException-based control flow for connection attempts, added debug-level logging in the catch block, and updated the RuntimeException thrown on close failure with a clearer, more descriptive message consistent with project conventions.\nlogic_customization: Maintained the original logic (successful connect means port not available; IOException means available), removed the initial “Testing port” message, and added debug logging reflecting port availability status.\nrefactoring: Added a concise Javadoc describing purpose, parameters, and return value; clarified local variable naming and comments for readability while keeping changes confined to this method.\nmisc: Replaced all console output with debug-level logging and applied minor formatting and comment cleanup consistent with the surrounding code style. New custom API calls used: org.jacorb.test.harness.TestUtils.getLogger() (static method returning org.slf4j.Logger)."}
