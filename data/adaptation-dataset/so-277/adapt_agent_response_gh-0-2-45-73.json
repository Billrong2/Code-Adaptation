  "explanation": "code_hardening: Added bounds checks on _position against _length, handled null version string defensively, and ensured _number and _suffix are reset on every MoveNext call to keep internal state consistent.\nresolve_compilation_errors: Implemented the missing MoveNext method using existing fields (_versionString, _length, _position, _number, _suffix) without introducing new dependencies or helpers; no external APIs were required.\nexception_handling: Chose not to throw checked exceptions during tokenization; unexpected characters are treated as part of the suffix per tokenizer semantics, and end-of-input cleanly returns false.\nlogic_customization: Replaced all comparison logic with single-string tokenization: parsing contiguous digits into _number, collecting suffix characters up to the next '.' or end of string, advancing the internal cursor, and returning false only when the end is reached.\nrefactoring: Used tokenizer-centric logic and field usage consistent with the renamed responsibility (token production rather than comparison) while keeping method naming compatible with existing usage (MoveNext).\nmisc: Kept formatting and comments minimal and consistent with existing style; no new custom API calls were introduced (none)."
