  "explanation": "code_hardening: none\nresolve_compilation_errors: none; the function relies on existing class fields and the already-imported org.ff4j.exception.FeatureAccessException.\nexception_handling: Replaced the generic RuntimeException in the broad catch (Exception e) with a FeatureAccessException, preserving the original message semantics and passing the caught exception as the cause. The checked IOException and SQLException are still explicitly caught and rethrown, and the method signature continues to declare throws IOException, SQLException.\nlogic_customization: none\nrefactoring: none\nmisc: none"
