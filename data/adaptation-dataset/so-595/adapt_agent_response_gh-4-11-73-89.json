  "explanation": "code_hardening: Added a null check for the encoded cookie string, validated hex decoding defensively, marked local variables as final where applicable, and used try-with-resources to ensure streams are always closed.\nresolve_compilation_errors: Removed all Android Context/SharedPreferences-related logic by introducing a standalone decode(String) method that relies only on existing class helpers (hexStringToByteArray) and standard java.io classes; no external dependencies were added.\nexception_handling: Wrapped deserialization in try-catch blocks for IOException and ClassNotFoundException, logging each failure via android.util.Log and returning null on any error as specified.\nlogic_customization: Implemented the decoding flow as deserialization (hex string to byte array, ObjectInputStream, SerializableHttpCookie, then HttpCookie) with no cookie store management, iteration, or persistence logic.\nrefactoring: Renamed the behavior to a clean decode method with a single responsibility and no side effects, replacing the former constructor-based loading approach.\nmisc: Updated logging messages to reflect decoding-specific failures in this simplified context; no new custom API calls were introduced."
