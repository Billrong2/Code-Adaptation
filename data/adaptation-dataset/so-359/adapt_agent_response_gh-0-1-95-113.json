  "explanation": "code_hardening: none\nresolve_compilation_errors: Replaced the custom logger with fully qualified android.util.Log.d calls to ensure Android compilation without adding imports.\nexception_handling: Preserved the existing try–catch–finally structure and exception types exactly, only changing the logging statements inside catch and finally.\nlogic_customization: none\nrefactoring: none\nmisc: Updated logging to use Log.d with the tag \"INFO\" in both catch and finally blocks, slightly revised the log message wording for clarity, and added an attribution comment referencing the StackOverflow source."
