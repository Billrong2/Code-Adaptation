  "explanation": "code_hardening: Ensured all I/O resources are safely closed by using a finally block to close both the BufferedInputStream and DiskLruCache.Snapshot, wrapped the raw stream in a BufferedInputStream with IO_BUFFER_SIZE, and guarded against null snapshot, InputStream, and decoded Bitmap.\nresolve_compilation_errors: Removed all write-related classes and calls (DiskLruCache.Editor, writeBitmapToFile, commit/abort/flush), changed the return type to Bitmap, and used existing fully qualified project APIs such as android.graphics.BitmapFactory and com.androidex.volley.misc.DiskLruCache.Snapshot.\nexception_handling: Implemented read-appropriate try/catch logic, catching IOException during cache access and decoding, printing the stack trace, and returning null on failure while still closing resources in finally.\nlogic_customization: Changed semantics from write to read by using mDiskCache.get(key) to obtain a Snapshot, returning null when absent, decoding index 0 InputStream into a Bitmap, and logging only after the read and only when a Bitmap was successfully decoded.\nrefactoring: Renamed the method to getBitmap with a Bitmap return type, simplified control flow by eliminating nested write conditionals, and removed all BuildConfig.DEBUG checks in favor of LogA.isDebug().\nmisc: Updated the log message to \"image read from disk {key}\" and added the @Override annotation to reflect implementation of the ImageCache interface; no new custom API calls beyond existing project utilities (com.androidex.utils.LogA.isDebug())."
