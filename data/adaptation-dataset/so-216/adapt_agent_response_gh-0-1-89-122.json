  "explanation": "code_hardening: Created all views with a guaranteed non-null Context from getActivity(), assigned explicit layout parameters, used final local variables, and suppressed resource-type lint warnings for programmatic ID assignment.\nresolve_compilation_errors: Introduced an onCreateView override to replace post-inflation assumptions, removed reliance on findViewById/getView() within this method, and ensured all referenced Android classes are fully resolvable in the existing file context.\nexception_handling: Eliminated runtime exceptions related to missing or mis-typed views by constructing the entire hierarchy directly; no try/catch blocks are required or added.\nlogic_customization: Shifted responsibility from ensureList-style post-inflation logic to always constructing and returning the default layout in onCreateView, configuring the ExpandableListView (IDs, layout params, selector-on-top) and the standard empty TextView by construction, while intentionally omitting adapter wiring, empty toggling, listeners, focus, and list-shown state.\nrefactoring: Simplified control flow by removing conditional branches and lookups, focusing this method solely on layout creation; the method name and lifecycle hook now clearly express its responsibility.\nmisc: Added descriptive inline comments documenting the default layout structure and clarifying how subclasses may rely on or override this behavior; formatting follows standard Android programmatic layout style."
