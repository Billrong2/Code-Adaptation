  "explanation": "code_hardening: none\nresolve_compilation_errors: Converted the method to public static so it can be called from getSimilarChatColor without an instance; kept the java.awt.Color type consistent with the existing codebase.\nexception_handling: none\nlogic_customization: none; the distance calculation, constants, and formula are identical to the original snippet.\nrefactoring: Performed minor formatting and whitespace cleanup for readability and adjusted numeric literals to use doubles consistently.\nmisc: Added a brief comment above the method citing Stack Overflow as the source of the algorithm; no new custom API calls were introduced."
