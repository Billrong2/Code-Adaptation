  "explanation": "code_hardening: Explicit null checking was intentionally removed so that a null input triggers a NullPointerException via length(), matching the new intended behavior. No additional hardening was added.\nresolve_compilation_errors: none.\nexception_handling: Removed the IllegalArgumentException for odd-length strings and instead implemented left-padding with '0'. No catching or wrapping of NullPointerException is performed so it propagates naturally to callers like checkSignature.\nlogic_customization: Added detection of odd-length hex strings and prepended a leading '0' before decoding, while preserving the original hex decoding logic.\nrefactoring: Replaced use of toCharArray() with direct String.charAt(int) access, removed public visibility to make the method package-private, and removed all final modifiers from the method signature and parameters.\nmisc: Added a documentation comment describing the updated behavior and expectations. No new custom API calls were introduced."
