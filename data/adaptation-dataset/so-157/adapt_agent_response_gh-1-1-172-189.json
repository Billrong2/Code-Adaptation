"explanation":"code_hardening: Added a null check for the Process parameter, enforced the UNIX-only guard, used final locals for reflective artifacts, and ensured the spawned kill process streams are closed after waiting to avoid resource leaks.\nresolve_compilation_errors: Updated the method to be an instance method with a void return type, renamed it to killQuitProcess, and used fully qualified java.lang.reflect.Field inside the body to avoid import issues.\nexception_handling: Expanded the throws clause to include IllegalArgumentException, NoSuchFieldException, IllegalAccessException, IOException, and InterruptedException, and propagated them consistently without wrapping.\nlogic_customization: Replaced PID-return logic with execution of \"/bin/kill -QUIT <pid>\" via Runtime.exec, preserved reflective PID extraction and UNIXProcess checking, and waited for the kill command to complete.\nrefactoring: Renamed the method to clearly indicate SIGQUIT behavior, removed console logging, and simplified local variable naming while keeping all logic within a single method.\nmisc: Added a concise Javadoc comment describing UNIX-only behavior and SIGQUIT semantics; no new custom APIs beyond Runtime.exec were introduced (none)."}
