  "explanation": "code_hardening: none; existing null checks and socket close logic were preserved exactly as in the original behavior.\nresolve_compilation_errors: removed references to undefined MIN_PORT_NUMBER and MAX_PORT_NUMBER by replacing them with explicit numeric bounds, ensuring the method compiles in the target codebase.\nexception_handling: none; the original try/catch/finally structure and handled exception types were left unchanged.\nlogic_customization: replaced the port validation condition with an explicit range check (1 <= port <= 65535) while preserving the IllegalArgumentException type and message structure.\nrefactoring: none; method name, signature, local variables, and control flow were kept identical to avoid behavioral changes.\nmisc: added Javadoc with attribution and basic @param/@return tags as a non-functional documentation update; no new custom API calls were introduced."
