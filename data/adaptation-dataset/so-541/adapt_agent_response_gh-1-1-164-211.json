  "explanation": "code_hardening: Added null checks for the MouseEvent, TreeModel, root, resolved TreePath, and internal state map; ignored clicks outside any row; consumed events to avoid unintended default behavior.\nresolve_compilation_errors: Implemented behavior entirely within an overridden JTree hook using fully qualified class names where needed; relied on existing fields and methods (nodesCheckingState, toggleCheckState) already present in the component.\nexception_handling: none.\nlogic_customization: Disabled default expand/collapse and selection by consuming mouse events and not calling super; handled left-button single clicks by resolving the TreePath at the cursor and toggling the node’s checked state; ignored clicks outside any path.\nrefactoring: Centralized mouse interaction logic in a single overridden method to replace demo-style external listeners and printing; removed reliance on selection mechanics by bypassing superclass processing.\nmisc: Added brief inline comments clarifying intent; no new custom API calls introduced (none)."
