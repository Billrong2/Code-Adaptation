  "explanation": "code_hardening: Kept behavior unchanged; no additional null checks were added to avoid altering runtime semantics, but reflective Method references were made final for immutability.\nresolve_compilation_errors: Used existing imports and types from the target codebase; no new types or imports were required.\nexception_handling: Preserved the original broad catch of Throwable and logging behavior exactly as in the source to avoid functional changes.\nlogic_customization: none.\nrefactoring: Standardized formatting, indentation, and brace placement; slightly clarified generic typing with Class<?> and made local Method variables final without changing logic.\nmisc: Retained the existing logging tag and message format to match project conventions."
