  "explanation": "code_hardening: none\nresolve_compilation_errors: implemented the missing peekAndReplace method so the class compiles; used the existing InputStream field 'in' available in the surrounding class.\nexception_handling: none; the method preserves the existing throws IOException contract without altering exception flow.\nlogic_customization: none; the logic is semantically identical to the Stack Overflow snippet and performs the same peek-and-replace behavior.\nrefactoring: none; no renaming or restructuring beyond adapting to the surrounding class context.\nmisc: formatting and brace placement match the surrounding code style; no additional comments or logging added."
