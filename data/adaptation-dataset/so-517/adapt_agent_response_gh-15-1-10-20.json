  "explanation": "code_hardening: none; the method retains the original behavior and assumptions, including no null or bounds checks.\nresolve_compilation_errors: none; the renamed method compiles cleanly within the existing class context without additional changes.\nexception_handling: none; no try/catch or throws clauses were introduced, preserving the original behavior.\nlogic_customization: none; the byte-to-uppercase-hex conversion logic is unchanged from the original snippet.\nrefactoring: the public static method was renamed from toHexString to encodeHexString, with minor formatting adjustments for readability while keeping the implementation identical.\nmisc: none"
